### 1.3 How Clarus Care uses Amazon Bedrock to deliver conversational contact center interactions

In this post, we illustrate how Clarus Care, a healthcare contact center solutions provider, worked with the AWS Generative AI Innovation Center (GenAIIC) team to develop a generative AI-powered contact center prototype. This solution enables conversational interaction and multi-intent resolution through an automated voicebot and chat interface. It also incorporates a scalable service model to support growth, human transfer capabilities--when requested or for urgent cases--and an analytics pi...

### 1.4 Build intelligent employee onboarding with Gemini Enterprise

Employee onboarding is rarely a linear process. It’s a complex web of dependencies that vary significantly based on an individual’s specific profile. For example, even a simple request for a laptop requires the system to cross-reference the employee’s role, function, and seniority level to determine whether they need a high-powered workstation or a standard mobile device. Similarly, requesting a building pass involves more than just a name tag; it requires integrating data regarding the emplo...

### 1.5 High-performance inference meets serverless compute with NVIDIA RTX PRO 6000 on Cloud Run

Running large-scale inference models can involve significant operational toil, including cluster management and manual VM maintenance. One solution is to leverage a serverless compute platform to abstract away the underlying infrastructure. Today, we’re bringing the serverless experience to high-end inference with support for NVIDIA RTX PRO™ 6000 Blackwell Server Edition GPUs on Cloud Run. Now in preview, you can deploy massive models like Gemma 3 27B or Llama 3.1 70B with the 'deploy and for...

## 2. DevOps & Cloud

### 2.1 Introducing Single-tenant Cloud HSM to support more data encryption control

Organizations that handle sensitive data in highly-regulated sectors often face a difficult choice: Build and manage physical hardware to meet strict compliance needs, or use cloud services that might not offer the specific level of isolation they require. These organizations, often in financial services, defense, healthcare, insurance, and government, require a key management service to provide cryptographic assurances that no one else — including their cloud provider — can access their keys...
